                        <strong>What is a succulent?</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        They look great on a sunny sill or side table. And, they’re real cute. All succulents are adapted to dry environments with full sun and no shelter. According to a NASA study, succulents have even been found to purify the air of harmful toxins. Succulents are excellent starter plants because they’re low maintenance.
                        <br><br>
                        Succulents (from the Latin word “succulentus,” for juice or sap) are defined by their moisture-storing capacity and come from many botanical families. Botanically-speaking, the term succulent refers to ANY plant that has evolved adaptations to survive hot arid environments. It is a term that does not refer to any specific family of plants, and, in fact, many succulent plants are not related to one another at all.
                        <br><br>
                        Succulents can include many structural characteristics: an epidermis with waxy cutin, thickened, fleshy leaves, an alternative mode of photosynthesis, and so on. Many plants would, by botanic definition, be considered succulent even though we do not normally think of them as such. For example, snake plants (Sansevieria) and Ponytail palms (Beaucarnea) both have different adaptations for surviving in desert conditions.
                        <br><br>
                        All cacti are succulents, but not all succulents are cacti. Cacti are succulents from the family Cactaceae, which only are native to the Western Hemisphere. The trait of succulence has evolved multiple times throughout plant history, each time as a response to climate shifts to more arid conditions. Other plants have evolved succulent characteristics, such as Yucca, Agave, and Aloe.

                        Here’s a quick guide on what succulents need and some pointers for keeping them healthy.
                        Sunlight
                        <br><br>
                        Thrives in bright direct light, but can tolerate bright indirect light. (Learn more about light requirements here)
                        Water
                        <br><br>
                        Size matters, but generally speaking, you can water these plants every 2-3 weeks, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Expect to water more often in brighter light and less often in lower light. Always be sure to research watering requirements for your specific succulent. (Learn more about water requirements here)
                        Humidity
                        <br><br>
                        Any! Succulents don't mind.
                        Temperature
                        <br><br>
                        65°F-90°F (18°C-33°C). It’s best not to let it go below 60°F (15°C).
                        Size
                        <br><br>
                        Dependent on species. Most grow slowly, so will remain the same size, or increase in size in flushes of growth.
                        Common Problems
                        <br><br>
                        Succulents are generally very easy-going plants. May get scale and mealybugs. Treat scale bugs and mealybugs as soon as they appear with weekly sprays of horticultural (Neem) oil.
                        <br><br>
                        SYMPTOM: Leaves curling or wrinkling, dry potting mix
                        <br><br>
                        CAUSE: Thirsty plant, underwatered
                        <br><br>
                        SYMPTOM: Yellowing leaves, wet potting mix
                        <br><br>
                        CAUSE: Root rot, overwatered
                        Precautions
                        <br><br>
                        Do not consume. Best practice is always to keep houseplants out of reach of small children and pets. (Learn more about plant toxicity here)
