                        Plants Make People Happy

                    <p class="has-text-primary">
                        This simple idea was the seed for what would become The Sill: a modern plant destination for the modern plant lover.
                        <br><br>
                        Plants make us happier, healthier, more efficient and boost our creativity. They even clean the air we breathe. But all our modern city-living has us indoors a lot. So we thought: why not bring the outdoors in? We think everyone deserves to have their own personal plant oasis.
                        <br><br>
                        And, we think finding your new plant should be, well, easy.

                        Take it from us, the plant category is difficult to navigate, especially as our shopping behaviors and expectations evolve. Our solution? Take the best parts of grandma’s garden supply center (the plants) and create a seamless shopping experience (without getting your hands too dirty).
                        <br><br>
                        The Sill started exclusively online, delivering potted houseplants like pizza to doorsteps all over the U.S.A. In New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco, our brick and mortar stores offer an escape from the concrete jungle, where we put our plants on display year-round and host weekly workshops. It’s quickly becoming everyone’s happy place.
                        <br><br>
                        Every plant from The Sill comes with care information and the support of our team of knowledgable plant parents. Our goal is to make the experience of being a plant parent as wonderful as the plants themselves. We’re here to inspire confidence in the next generation of plant parents.
